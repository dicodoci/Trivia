# Trivia

This is an adroid app that implements a quiz based on Jeopardy questions, using a [Jeopardy questions api](http://jservice.io/).

The database for the scoreboard was implemented using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

The similarities between input and the correct answer were calculated using the [Levenshtein Edit Distance Algorithm in Java](https://gist.github.com/gabhi/11243437)
